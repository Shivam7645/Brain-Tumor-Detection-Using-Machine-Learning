# Brain Tumor Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors using machine learning algorithms. The aim is to assist in the early detection of brain tumors by analyzing medical images and identifying the presence of tumors with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes various machine learning techniques to classify brain images as either tumor or non-tumor. The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images, and different algorithms are evaluated to determine the most effective approach for accurate detection.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: MRI images are preprocessed to enhance features and improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are explored for tumor detection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models.
- **Google Colab Integration**: The project is run on Google Colab, leveraging its GPU support for faster computation.
